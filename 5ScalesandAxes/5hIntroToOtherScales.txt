Quantile, Quantize, Threshold Scales

Quantile e.g divide data into 100 groups creating percentiles
i.e. percentile = quantile with 100 sections

quartile is a quantile with 4 sections

Quantize scales split data into even sections. Map data to discrete set of outputs. e.g domain = 0â€“100. Array = [2, 3, 8];

input of 32 outputs 2, input 33 outputs 3.

Threshold scale allows to set arbitrary values.
Usually theres a min and amx with most scales.

https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4573883 shows anything above 50% as bad. Anything smaller is split into smaller uneven categories.
